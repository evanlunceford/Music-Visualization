THIS TOOL IS IN DEVELOPMENT

This tool is aiming to allow for visualization of audio. Similar to Apple's old iTunes feature, the goal is to create live visualizations based on the
sound being inputted. This can be in the form of music, conversation, or just static sound around your room.



Backend is mainly object-oriented in order to increase modularity based on what you want to use this tool for.
